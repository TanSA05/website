I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto, advised by [Robert Soden](http://robertsoden.io/) and [Steve Easterbrook](https://www.environment.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/steve-easterbrook). I'm part of the [Toronto Climate Observatory](https://www.climateobservatory.ca/).

My research envisions a human-centered approach to climate data, risk and modeling that expands contemporary climate technologies to be more place-based and environmentally just. I hope to contribute to this vision by unpacking the complexities of environmental information infrastructures, and shifting attention to the sociotechnical practices that both enact and shape the politics and possibilities of climate action. I use a range of HCI methodologies like critical, speculative, and participatory design in my research. 

**Research Interests**: Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Critical Computing, Climate Risk Modeling, Climate Change, Climate Services, Critical Data Studies, Digital Interaction
